This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

# Description

Væske is a two sided marketplace brining together home owners and Home Equity Investors to benefit both sides of complex transactions. It consists of two main parts.

1. A Home Owner Portal where users can upload information about their properties and receive bids from Home Equity Investors and other Prop Techs.
2. A Investor/Prop Tech Portal where they can create their own buy boxes, view the properties that match said buyboxes, and offer bids to the homeowners.
